# Stitches-solver
Solver for the game "Stitches"

Basic Rules of Stitches:

Connect Each Block to ALL Its Neighbors:
The primary objective in Stitches is to connect each block to all its neighbors. This connection is established by a "stitch" between two adjacent blocks.
Stitches Between Adjacent Blocks:
Each "stitch" represents a connection between two adjacent cells, either horizontally or vertically, from two distinct blocks. Players must strategically maneuver to establish these crucial links.
Prohibition of Converging Stitches:
Two "stitches" cannot originate from the same hole. This rule adds a layer of complexity to the game, requiring players to carefully plan their moves to avoid problematic intersections.
Number Indicators:
The numbers arranged around the grid serve as essential guides. They indicate the number of holes present in the respective row or column. Players must adhere to these indicators to reach the optimal solution.
